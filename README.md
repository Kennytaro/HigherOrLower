# HigherOrLower
A simple higher or lower game that can be played in the console.

A player will input a number (only between 0 to 100) 
The program will pull a random number out of the range(0 - 100) 
The program will ask the question if you think its higher or lower than the number you input
If you say yes a message will pop up saying that and you will get a point 
If wrong, a message will pop up saying that and you wonâ€™t get a point
The game will end when you stop the code
